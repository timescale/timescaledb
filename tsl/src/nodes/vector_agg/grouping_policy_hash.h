/*
 * Hash grouping policy.
 *
 * The grouping and aggregation is performed as follows:
 *
 * 0) The grouping policy keeps track of the unique grouping keys seen in
 * the input rows, and the states of aggregate functions for each key. This
 * spans multiple input compressed batches, and is reset after the partial
 * aggregation results are emitted.
 *
 * 1) For each row of the new compressed batch, we obtain an index that
 * uniquely identifies its grouping key. This is done by matching the row's
 * grouping columns to the hash table recording the unique grouping keys and
 * their respective indexes. It is performed in bulk for all rows of the batch,
 * to improve memory locality. The details of this are managed by the hashing
 * strategy.
 *
 * 2) The key indexes are used to locate the aggregate function states
 * corresponding to a given row's key, and update it. This is done in bulk for all
 * rows of the batch, and for each aggregate function separately, to generate
 * simpler and potentially vectorizable code, and improve memory locality.
 *
 * 3) After the input has ended, or if the memory limit is reached, the partial
 * results are emitted into the output slot. This is done in the order of unique
 * grouping key indexes, thereby preserving the incoming key order. This
 * guarantees that this policy works correctly even in a Partial GroupAggregate
 * node, even though it's not optimal performance-wise.
