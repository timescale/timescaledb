/*
 * This header describes the Arrow C data interface which is a well-known
 * standard for in-memory interchange of columnar data.
 *
 * https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html
 *
 * Citing from the above link:
 *
 * Arrow C data interface defines a very small, stable set of C definitions that
 * can be easily copied in any projectâ€™s source code and used for columnar data
 * interchange in the Arrow format. For non-C/C++ languages and runtimes, it
 * should be almost as easy to translate the C definitions into the
 * corresponding C FFI declarations.
 *
 * Applications and libraries can therefore work with Arrow memory without
 * necessarily using Arrow libraries or reinventing the wheel.
