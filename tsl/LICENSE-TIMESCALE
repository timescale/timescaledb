Posted Date:  December 19, 2018

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THIS TIMESCALE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("TSL Agreement"), WHICH
CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT AND GOVERNS USE OF THE TIMESCALE
TIME-SERIES DATABASE SOFTWARE AND RELATED SOFTWARE THAT IS PROVIDED SUBJECT TO
THIS TSL AGREEMENT.  BY INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU
HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL
AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT
INSTALL OR USE SUCH SOFTWARE.  IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE ON
BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT
LEGAL ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO BIND THAT LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS TSL AGREEMENT.

This TSL Agreement is entered into by and between Timescale, Inc. ("Timescale")
and you or the legal entity on whose behalf you are accepting this TSL
Agreement ("You").

0. BACKGROUND

   The Timescale time-series database software and related software is offered
   as "open code" or "source-available" code.  This means that all source code
   of the software is available for inspection and download at
   https://github.com/timescale.  The Timescale software is composed of two
   major pieces.

   The first, core piece (referred to herein as the Timescale Open Source
   Software, as defined below) is open source software that is licensed under
   the Apache Version 2.0 license.

   The second piece (referred to herein as the TSL Licensed Software, as
   defined below) is all of the Timescale Software other than the Timescale
   Open Source Software.

   Certain functions or features of the TSL Licensed Software (referred to
   herein as Community Features, as defined below) may be used under this TSL
   Agreement without charge, in some cases subject to certain usage limits that
   may be imposed by a software license key and/or technical restrictions in
   the code.

   Certain other functions or features of the TSL Licensed Software (referred
   to herein as Enterprise Features, as defined below) may be used either
   solely under a Commercial License Agreement subject to charge, or under this
   TSL Agreement without charge only for a limited time trial period.  In order
   to use such features, You must obtain an appropriate license key.

   You may find more information at https://www.timescale.com/pricing about
   which functions and features of the TSL Licensed Software are classified as
   Community Features and Enterprise Features, details about any applicable
   usage limits and trial periods, and a description of how You can obtain any
   required license keys and enter into a Commercial License Agreement with
   Timescale.

1. GOVERNING LICENSES

   1.1 Source Code.  The source code for all Timescale Software is made
   publicly available by Timescale at https://github.com/timescale.  However,
   different license agreements govern the use of different parts of the
   Timescale Software source code.  The use of Timescale Open Source Software,
   in both source and executable forms, is governed by the terms of the Apache
   License Version 2.0, a copy of which is available at
   https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.  The use of all other Timescale
   Software in source code form is governed by this TSL Agreement and/or a
   Commercial License Agreement, as applicable.

   1.2 Commercial License Rights.  If You desire to use Community Features
   beyond applicable Usage Limits, or to use Enterprise Features beyond an
   applicable trial period (or those Enterprise Features that are not available
   for use under this TSL Agreement at all), as the case may be, You must
   obtain an appropriate License Key and enter into a Commercial License
   Agreement with Timescale, subject to applicable charges.

   1.3 License Rights to Your Customers.  As set forth in Section 2.1 below,
   the use by Your customers of the Timescale Software as part of any Value
   Added Products or Services that You distribute will be subject to the most
   current version of this TSL Agreement, including any applicable Usage Limits
   and restrictions on the use of Enterprise Features.  If Your customers
   desire to use any functions or features of the Timescale Software beyond
   applicable Usage Limits, or to use Enterprise Features, they must enter into
   a Commercial License Agreement with Timescale and obtain any necessary
   License Keys.

2. GRANT OF LICENSES

   of this TSL Agreement, Timescale grants to You at no charge the following

      for potential incorporation into Timescale's maintained code base at its
      sole discretion.

   2.2 Prohibitions.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this TSL
   Agreement, You are prohibited from (i) using any TSL Licensed Software to

8. GENERAL

   8.1 Complete Agreement.  This TSL Agreement completely and exclusively
   states the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter
   hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, or other
   communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject
   matter.

   8.2 Modification.  This TSL Agreement may be modified by Timescale from time
   to time, and any such modifications will be effective upon the "Posted Date"
   set forth at the top of the modified agreement. The modified agreement shall
   govern any new version of the TSL Licensed Software (and all its constituent
   source code and binaries) that is officially released as a complete version
   release by Timescale on or after such Posted Date. Except as set forth in
   this Section 8.2, this TSL Agreement may not be amended except by a writing
   executed by both parties.

   8.3 Governing Law.  This TSL Agreement shall be governed by and construed

   United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
   or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall apply.

   8.4 Unenforceability.  If any provision of this TSL Agreement is held
   unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this TSL Agreement shall remain
   in effect and the unenforceable provision shall be replaced by an
   enforceable provision that best reflects the original intent of the parties.

   8.5 Injunctive Relief.  You acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach
   of any provision of this TSL Agreement will cause irreparable harm to
   Timescale for which damages at law will not provide adequate relief, and
   Timescale shall therefore be entitled to injunctive relief against such
   breach or threatened breach without being required to post a bond.

   8.6 Assignment.  You may not assign this TSL Agreement, including by
   operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition or otherwise, in

   documentation are "Commercial Items", as that term is defined at 48
   C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial
   Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48
   C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable,
