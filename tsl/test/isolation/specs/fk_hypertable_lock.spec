# Test FOR KEY SHARE locking during FK constraint enforcement.
#
# When inserting into a table with an FK reference, PostgreSQL runs an FK check
# query that acquires FOR KEY SHARE locks on the referenced rows. This lock must
# block concurrent DELETE/UPDATE of the referenced row until the FK-inserting
# transaction commits.
#
# Without proper locking, a race condition can occur:
#   1. S1: INSERT into FK table, FK check finds referenced row (lock not acquired)
#   2. S2: DELETE from PK table succeeds (no lock blocking it)
#   3. S1: INSERT commits
#   4. Result: FK violation - orphan row in FK table
#
# This test compares three table types:
#   1. Plain table - Reference implementation, correct behavior
#   2. Declaratively partitioned table - PostgreSQL native partitioning
#   3. Hypertable - TimescaleDB partitioning
#
# Expected behavior: DELETE should block while INSERT is in progress, then fail
# with FK violation error after INSERT commits.
