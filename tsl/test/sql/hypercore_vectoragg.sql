-- Test VectorAgg on top of scans with Hypercore TAM.
--
-- This test is not for the vectorized aggregation functionality
-- itself, since that is handled by other tests. Here we only test
-- that VectorAgg is compatible with scans on Hypercore TAM and that
-- the planning is done correctly.
--
-- To run on a larger data set, the vectorized_aggregation and
-- vector_agg_* tests can be run with TAM enabled by default. This is
-- also a good way to verify that the output from Hypercore TAM is the
-- same.
