# IoT Sensors Example

**Status: Placeholder - To be implemented**

This example will demonstrate IoT device monitoring and analytics patterns with TimescaleDB.

## What You'll Learn

- Multi-metric sensor data modeling
- Time-based aggregations for monitoring
- Continuous aggregates for real-time dashboards
- Downsampling and data retention patterns

## Files

- `iot-schema.sql` - Schema definition (ready)
- `iot-sample-data.csv` - Sample sensor data (to be added)
- `iot-queries.sql` - Sample queries (to be added)

## Use Cases

Manufacturing monitoring, smart home systems, industrial IoT, environmental monitoring
