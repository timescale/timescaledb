name: Assign PR to author and reviewers

# This workflow runs on the pull_request_target event:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target.
#
# So the secrets are accessible even if the PR was opened from an external
# repository. This is done because the GitHub API key needs to be accessed
# to modify the PRs.
#
# NOTE: Only API calls should be made in the actions defined here. The
#       committed code should _NOT_ be touched in any case.
