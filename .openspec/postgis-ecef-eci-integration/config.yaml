  Project: TimescaleDB + PostGIS ECEF/ECI Integration
  Tech stack: C (PostgreSQL extension), SQL, PL/pgSQL
  Build system: CMake
  Testing: PostgreSQL regression tests (pg_regress)

  This is a multi-repo integration:
  - timescaledb (this repo): time-series storage, partitioning, compression, continuous aggregates
  - postgis fork (montge/postgis): ECEF/ECI types, SRIDs, frame conversions

  The interface contract (interface-contract.md) defines the boundary between repos.
  Any changes to the contract must be coordinated across both repositories.

  Coordinate frames:
  - ECEF (Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed): SRID 4978, rotates with Earth
  - ECI J2000 (Earth-Centered Inertial): SRID 900001 (proposed), inertial frame
  - Conversion is time-dependent (Earth rotation angle + precession/nutation)
rules:
  specs:
    - "Include coordination points section listing what is needed from/provided to PostGIS fork"
    - "Reference interface-contract.md for any cross-repo type or function dependencies"
    - "Include open questions that block implementation"
  design:
    - "Document which TimescaleDB extension points are used (no core modifications)"
    - "Include performance implications and expected compression ratios"
  tasks:
    - "Mark tasks that depend on PostGIS fork deliverables with [BLOCKED:postgis]"
    - "Include integration test tasks that require both extensions loaded"
