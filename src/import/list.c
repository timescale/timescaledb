	 * Normally, we set up a list with some extra cells, to allow it to grow
	 * without a repalloc.  Prefer cell counts chosen to make the total
	 * allocation a power-of-2, since palloc would round it up to that anyway.
	 * (That stops being true for very large allocations, but very long lists
	 * are infrequent, so it doesn't seem worth special logic for such cases.)
	 *
	 * The minimum allocation is 8 ListCell units, providing either 4 or 5
	 * available ListCells depending on the machine's word width.  Counting
	 * palloc's overhead, this uses the same amount of space as a one-cell
	 * list did in the old implementation, and less space for any longer list.
	 *
	 * We needn't worry about integer overflow; no caller passes min_size
	 * that's more than twice the size of an existing list, so the size limits
	 * within palloc will ensure that we don't overflow here.
